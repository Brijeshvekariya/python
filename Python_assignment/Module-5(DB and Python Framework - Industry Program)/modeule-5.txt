(1) Why Django should be used for web-development? Explain how you can create a project in Django?
-> Django is a fantastic choice for web development due to several compelling reasons:
    High-level Framework: Django is a high-level web framework that simplifies the development process. It provides pre-built components and tools, allowing developers to focus on building their application rather than reinventing the wheel.

    Batteries Included: Django comes with a wide range of functionalities out-of-the-box. It includes an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for database interactions, a robust admin panel for content management, URL routing, authentication, and much more, reducing the need for external libraries for common tasks.

    Security: Security is a top priority in Django. It offers built-in protection against common web security threats like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and clickjacking. This helps developers create more secure web applications by default.

    To create a project in Django:

    python -m venv myenv
    to create virtual environment


    D:\brijesh\Django\myenv\Scripts>activate
    to activate virtual environment

    (myenv) D:\brijesh\Django>pip install django
    then install django

    (myenv) D:\brijesh\Django>django-admin --version
    to check django version

    (myenv) D:\brijesh\Django>django-admin startproject basicprojects
    to create projects

    (myenv) D:\brijesh\Django\basicprojects>code .
    to open project in vscode

    (myenv) D:\brijesh\Django\basicprojects>python manage.py startapp myapp
    to create app

    (myenv) D:\brijesh\Django\basicprojects>python manage.py runserver      
    to run server


(2) How to check installed version of django?
-> You can check the installed version of Django by running the following command in your terminal:
    python -m django --version

(3) Explain what does django-admin.py make messages command is used for?
->  The django-admin.py make messages command is used to create a new message file in your Django project. This command is particularly useful when you want to create a new message file for a specific app.
    The purpose of django-admin.py make messages is to extract translatable strings from the codebase and create or update message files, not specifically to create a new message file for a Django project or app.

(4) What is Django URLs? make program to create django urls?
->  In Django, URLs are mappings between URL patterns and view functions or classes. They define how URLs should be structured in an application and which view to call when a specific URL pattern is matched.

    Here's an example of how you can create Django URLs in your project: 
    # In myapp/urls.py
    from django.urls import path
    from . import views

    urlpatterns = [
        path('', views.home, name='home'),  # Mapping the root URL to the home view
        path('about/', views.about, name='about'),  # Mapping the '/about/' URL to the about view
        # Add more URL patterns as needed
    ]

(5) What is a QuerySet?Write program to create a new Post object in database:
->  A QuerySet is a collection of objects, which is returned by the database when you perform a query.
    Here's an example of creating a new Post object and saving it to the database using a QuerySet:
    # In myapp/models.py
    
    from django.db import models
    
    class Post(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    content = models.TextField()
    
    # In myapp/views.py
    
    from django.shortcuts import render
    from .models import Post
   
    def create_post(request):
        if request.method == 'POST':
            title = request.POST['title']
            content = request.POST['content']
            new_post = Post(title=title, content=content)
            new_post.save()
            return render(request, 'create_post.html')

(6) Mention what command line can be used to load data into Django? 
-> You can use the following command to load data into Django:
    python manage.py loaddata <filename>

    python manage.py loaddata fixture_file_name
    .json
    file is also supported.

(7) Explain what does django-admin.py make messages command is used for?
->  The django-admin.py make messages command is used to create a new message file in your Django project. This command is particularly useful when you want to create a new message file for a specific app.
    The purpose of django-admin.py make messages is to extract translatable strings from the codebase and create or update message files, not specifically to create a new message file for a Django project or app.
