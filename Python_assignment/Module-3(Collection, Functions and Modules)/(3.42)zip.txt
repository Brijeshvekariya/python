(Q) why we use zip() method in Python

    The zip() function in Python is used to combine two or more iterables (e.g., lists, tuples, or other iterable objects) element-wise into dictionary or tuples. 
    Each tuple or dictionary produced by zip() contains elements from the corresponding positions of the input iterables. 
    In other words, it pairs up elements from the input iterables based on their positions, creating dictionary or tuples

    eg.

    l1 = [1,2,3]
    l2 = ['a','b','c']

    d = dict(zip(l1,l2))
