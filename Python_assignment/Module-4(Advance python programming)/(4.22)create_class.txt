(Q) How to Define a Class in Python? What Is Self? Give An Example of a Python Class

->  In Python, you can define a class using the class keyword. 
    A class is a blueprint for creating objects, and it defines a set of attributes (variables) and methods (functions) that the objects created from the class will have. 
    Here's the basic syntax for defining a class:

    class ClassName:
        attributes and methods
    
    Within a class, you can define attributes and methods. Attributes are variables that hold data, and methods are functions that perform actions on the data or manipulate the object's state.

    What is SELF?

    The self parameter is a convention in Python used to refer to the instance of the class (i.e., the object itself) within the class's methods. 
    It allows you to access and modify the object's attributes and call its methods from within the class.

    Example of Python class:

    class Student:
    stid = 1
    stname = "Brijesh"

    def getdata(self):
        print("This is the data of Student")

    # object creation
    st = Student()
    print(st.stid)
    print(st.stname)
    st.getdata()
