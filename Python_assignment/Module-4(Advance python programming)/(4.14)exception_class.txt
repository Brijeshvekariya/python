(Q) How many except statements can a try-except block have? Name Some built-in exception classes: 

->  A try-except block in Python can have multiple except statements to handle different types of exceptions. 
    There is no hard limit to the number of except statements you can have in a single try block. 
    You can specify as many except blocks as needed to handle various types of exceptions that your code might encounter.

    Here are some examples of built-in exception classes in Python:

    ZeroDivisionError: Raised when you try to divide a number by zero.

    ValueError: Raised when a function receives an argument of the correct data type but an inappropriate value.

    TypeError: Raised when an operation or function is applied to an object of an inappropriate type.

    FileNotFoundError: Raised when an attempt to open or manipulate a file that doesn't exist occurs.

    IndexError: Raised when you try to access an index that is out of range for a sequence (e.g., a list or string).

    NameError: Raised when you try to access a variable or name that hasn't been defined.
