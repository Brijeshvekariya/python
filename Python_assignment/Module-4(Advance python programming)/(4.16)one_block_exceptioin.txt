(Q) Can one block of except statements handle multiple exception?

->  Yes, you can use a single block of except statements to handle multiple exceptions in Python. 
    To do this, you can specify multiple exception types in a tuple within a single except block. 
    This allows you to catch and handle different types of exceptions with the same block of code.

    example code:

    try:
        result = 10 / 0
    except (ZeroDivisionError, ValueError):
        print("An error occurred")

    In this example, the except block catches both ZeroDivisionError and ValueError exceptions. 
    If either of these exceptions is raised in the try block, the code in the except block will execute.
