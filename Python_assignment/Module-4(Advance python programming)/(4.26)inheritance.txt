(Q) Explain Inheritance in Python with an example? What is init? Or What is a Constructor In Python?

->  Inheritance in Python is a fundamental object-oriented programming (OOP) concept that allows you to create a new class (called a subclass or derived class) that inherits properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) from an existing class (called a superclass or base class). 
    This allows you to reuse and extend the functionality of the base class, promoting code reusability and creating a hierarchical structure of classes.

    Here's an example to illustrate inheritance in Python:

    class Parent:
        def __init__(self):
            print("Family")

        def house(self):
            print("3 BHK House")

    class Child(Parent):
        def car(self):
            print("Mercedez car")

    c = Child()
    c.car() 
    c.house()

->  The __init__ method in Python is a special method called a constructor. 
    It is automatically invoked when an instance of a class is created. 
    The purpose of the constructor is to initialize the attributes of the class. 
    In the example above, the __init__ method in the Parent class print Family. 
    The Child subclasses inherit this constructor and can also add their own attributes or perform additional initialization.
