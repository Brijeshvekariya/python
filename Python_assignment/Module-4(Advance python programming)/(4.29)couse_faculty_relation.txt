(Q) What relationship is appropriate for Course and Faculty?

-> In a database management system (DBMS), the relationship between a "Course" table and a "Faculty" table would typically be a MANY-to-MANY relationship.
    This means that multiple courses can be taught by multiple faculty members, and each faculty member can teach multiple courses.
