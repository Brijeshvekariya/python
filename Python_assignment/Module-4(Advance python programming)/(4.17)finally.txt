(Q) When is the finally block executed? 

->  The finally block always executes after normal termination of try block or after except block if try block terminates due to some exception
    The primary purpose of the finally block is to ensure that critical cleanup or resource release code is executed regardless of whether an exception occurs or not. 
    It's commonly used when working with files, databases, network connections, or other resources that need to be closed or released properly, even in the presence of exceptions.
