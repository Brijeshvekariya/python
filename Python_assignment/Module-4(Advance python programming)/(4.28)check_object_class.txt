(Q) What is used to check whether an object o is an instance of class A?

->  In Python, you can use the isinstance() function to check whether an object o is an instance of a specific class, such as class A. 
    The isinstance() function takes two arguments: 
        the object you want to check, and the class (or tuple of classes) you want to check against.

    for example:

        if isinstance(object, class):
            # o is an instance of class A
            print("object is an instance of class")
        else:
            # o is not an instance of class A
            print("Object is not an instance of class")
