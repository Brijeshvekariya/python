(Q) What is Instantiation in terms of OOP terminology? 

->  In object-oriented programming (OOP) terminology, "instantiation" refers to the process of creating an instance (or object) of a class. 
    An instance is a specific, unique occurrence of a class, and it can be thought of as an individual object with its own set of attributes and behaviors, as defined by the class.

->  Instantiation is the process of creating an object based on a class. It involves calling the class's constructor (often named __init__ in Python) to initialize the object's attributes and set it up for use.

    for example:

        class Person:
            def __init__(self, name, age):
                self.name = name
                self.age = age

        # Instantiating two Person objects
        person1 = Person("Brijesh", 23)
        person2 = Person("Dhoni", 45)
